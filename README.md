# Retrieval-Based Chatbots

## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains mini-projects related to **Retrieval-Based Chatbots**, inspired by Codecademy's chatbot development lessons. Retrieval-based chatbots are widely used in customer service, e-commerce, and AI assistants to provide structured responses based on predefined data.

## 🤖 What is a Retrieval-Based Chatbot?
A **retrieval-based chatbot** selects responses from a predefined set based on user input. Unlike generative models, which create new sentences, retrieval-based models rely on **intent classification, entity recognition, and response selection** to provide meaningful answers.

## 🔍 Key Components
1. **Intent Classification** – Determines what the user is asking (e.g., "What is the shipping cost?" vs. "When will my order arrive?").
2. **Entity Recognition** – Identifies key details in the user’s message (e.g., dates, product names, locations).
3. **Response Selection** – Chooses the most appropriate response from a database based on the identified intent and entities.

## 🛠️ Projects in This Repository
This repository includes practical implementations of retrieval-based chatbot concepts, including:
- **AlienBot**: A chatbot that recognizes user intent and responds accordingly.
- **Intent-Based Response System**: A chatbot that selects responses based on predefined categories.
- **Basic NLP Techniques**: Implementations of Bag-of-Words and word embeddings to improve chatbot understanding.
